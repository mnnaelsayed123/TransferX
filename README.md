 # TransferX
 
   ### **Description** :

   
  > TransferX is a simple console-based application designed to simulate basic money transfer operations. The program allows users to transfer funds between 
 different accounts using a command-line interface. With easy-to-understand functionality, users can input transfer details like amounts and recipient 
 information, and the system will process the transactions securely and efficiently.


### **TransferX goals** :


 > TransferX was built with the purpose of applying the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **SOLID principles**. By leveraging these software design concepts, TransferX demonstrates how OOP techniques like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be used to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable money transfer system
